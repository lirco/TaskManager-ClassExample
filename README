Example for the Angularjs course students:

to use this example:

- run bower install and npm install
- this project use gulp to concat all js files into the 'dist' folder. **don`t forget to launch 'gulp' from the command line!**
- this project also contains pre-configured karma file. (gulp task for testing will be added at a later time)
